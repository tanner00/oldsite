This project is intended as both a learning experience for myself and the readers I hope it attracts. My goal is to detail the process of creating an x86 Operating System in Assembly. I also want to show that this doesn't have to be an intimidating subject. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions on how to explain something more easily, please tell me by creating a new issue here: [Website's Github page](https://github.com/tanner00/tanner00.github.io)!
